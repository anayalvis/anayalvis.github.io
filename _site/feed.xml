  &lt;p&gt;Why not make a conscious decision to learn something new every day? 
No matter how small the daily learning, it is significant when aggregated over a lifetime. 
Resolving early in life to have a continuous learning mindset is not only more interesting 
than the passive alternative, it is also remarkably powerful. 
Choosing lifelong learning is one of the few good choices that can make a big difference in our lives, 
giving us an enormous advantage when practised over a long period â€“Laurence Endersen&lt;/p&gt;
